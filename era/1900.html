          <p>When the "i" icon is tapped, an information window is shown. This window gives a brief description of how dating was viewed and pursued in that particular era. There are also a set of rules for participants to follow in order to maintain the most authentic experience possible.</p>

          <p>When a man is viewing a woman's profile, he will see her profile picture, first name, age, occupation and salary, and two buttons. He can swipe left or tap the "x" icon if he is not interested. Or he can swipe right or tap the "calling card" icon if he wishes to pursue her. </p>

          <p>Once a man has decided to pursue a woman, he will see the "Calling Card" screen. Here, he can select from three individuals to contact about taking the woman on a date. These individuals are preselected by the woman as potential chaperones. The man must choose one to send a calling card to. The message will be sent to either the individual's Facebook or email account. It will contain an image of the man, his name, age, occupation, salary, and his intentions.</p>

          <p>When the individual receives the calling card, they may choose to accept or decline. The man is notified either way. If the invitation is declined, contact ends and the womanâ€™s profile disappears from his selections. If the invitation is accepted, the individual confirms time and place with the man and will chaperone the dates. NOTE: Once a calling card has been accepted, the man will be unable to view other potential matches.</p>

      <div class="wprofile box">
          <img src="images/1900women1.png" alt="not supported">
          <p>As was custom for the time, women have very little say in who they will date. All communication prior to the date is done between the man and chaperone. If a calling card is accepted, the woman will be notified that a card was accepted, the first name of the man, and who accepted it. However, she will not be able to see the man's profile information.</p>
