            <p>When the "i" icon is tapped, an information window is shown. This window gives a brief description of how dating was viewed and pursued in that particular era. There are also a set of rules for participants to follow in order to maintain the most authentic experience possible.</p>

            <p>Profiles for both men and women are very similar. All profiles show a profile picture, name, age, as well as an "i" icon. This icon opens a page which shows his or her preferences with drugs, alochol, sexual activities, their last visit to the clinic to be checked for STD's, and any known STD's. On a woman's profile, a man can also see the form of birth control she is using. Both men and women can swipe left or tap the "x" icon if they are not interested. Or they can swipe right or tap the "heart" icon if they wish to chat with the other person. As individuals are swiping through potentially matches, periodically a VD prevention poster will pop up. At the bottom of the poster is an "i" icon which leads to an informational page.</p>

        <p>Both men and women are notified if they have a match. Either of them can message the other first. They may hit the forward arrow to proceed to the chat screen or select the back arrow to continue looking through potential matches. For additional awareness, a VD prevention poster will be visible on the match screen.</p>

          <p>The chat screen is relatively standard to most mobile dating apps on the market today. There is an added "POSTERS" button which allows you to send VD awareness posters to whoever you are messaging.</p>
