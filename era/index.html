<h4>What is it?</h4>
<p>Era is a dating app that reaches back in time to allow users to find a dating style that works best for them. This app provides six dating era options which all work in a similar way to the dating styles of its time. </p>
<h4>For Whom?</h4>
<p>For the teenager who is curious what dating was like in the 1920s or the middle-aged bachelor who misses the dating trends of the 1980s, Era encompasses dating preferences from the 1900s to present day. Easy to use and accessible from your mobile device, this dating app is designed for anyone who is interested in dating as if they were in a different era.</p>
<h4>Why use it?</h4>
<p>Let's face it. Dating apps of today all follow the same dating style which is often ineffective. People of the dating pool today deserve more options. Era allows individuals 16 to 96 to date in a way that feels comfortable to them.  </p>
<h4>When is it used?</h4>
<p>Era can be used anywhere at anytime. For the single sweetheart on the go, or the bored bachelor with nothing better to do, Era can be accessed from your mobile device.</p>
