            <p>When the "i" icon is tapped, an information window is shown. This window gives a brief description of how dating was viewed and pursued in that particular era. There are also a set of rules for participants to follow in order to maintain the most authentic experience possible.</p>

            <p>Once the 2000s button has been selected, the individual will be directly to a new screen which gives them the options between, friends, relationship, or hook-up. An individual's potential matches will only be others who selected the same button. </p>

              <p>For all three options, both men and women profile styles are the same. All profiles show a profile picture, name, age, and occupation. The friends option shows a Facebook icon which allows individuals to connect on Facebook, plan events, and invite friends to join. The relationship option will show an "i" icon which links to a biography page. The hook up option does not include anything but the basics. Both men and women can swipe left or tap the "x" icon if they are not interested. Or they can swipe right or tap the "heart" icon if they wish to chat with the other person.</p>

      <div class="match box">

        <p>Both men and women are notified if they have a match. Either of them can message the other first. They may hit the forward arrow to proceed to the chat screen or select the back arrow to continue looking through potential matches.</p>

          <p>The chat screen is relatively standard to most mobile dating apps on the market today. If you selected the "Friends" button, a Facebook icon will be present in the text field. This allows for the individuals to create an event on Facebook or invite friends to meet up.</p>
