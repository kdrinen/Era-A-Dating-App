            <p>When the "i" icon is tapped, an information window is shown. This window gives a brief description of how dating was viewed and pursued in that particular era. There are also a set of rules for participants to follow in order to maintain the most authentic experience possible.</p>

            <p>Profiles for both men and women are very similar. All profiles show a profile picture, name, and age. On a man's profile, women will also see the man's height, weight, and BMI. This era is primarily focused on physical appearances and health. Men with the best BMI ratio will appear first in a woman's potential matches. Both men and women can swipe left or tap the "x" icon if they are not interested. Or they can swipe right or tap the "heart" icon if they wish to chat with the other person.</p>

        <p>Both men and women are notified if they have a match. However, the woman must message first. She may hit the forward arrow to proceed to the chat screen. Both men and women can select the back arrow to continue looking through potential matches.</p>

      <div class="chat box">
          <img src="images/1940chatscreen.png" alt="not supported">
          <p>The chat screen is relatively standard to most mobile dating apps on the market today. However, if the man wants to make their relationship known to their friends and family, he may select the "GO STEADY" button. This will create a notification on each of their facebook timelines and disable the ability for either party to view other potential matches.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="fb box">
      <img src="images/facebooksnapshot.png" alt="not supported">
      <p>The Facebook post that is created when the man taps the "GO STEADY" button is similar to an "in a relationship" post. A jersey jacket icon will appear which is suited to the era. An article of clothing was often given to the woman as a sign of the couple's exclusiveness.</p>
